Seamless integration of TopUp (similar to Lightview, Lightbox, Thickbox, Floatbox, Fancybox) to create a nice overlay to display images and videos without the need to change html.

== Description ==

TopUp is a jQuery based wordpress plugin which implements [TopUp](http://gettopup.com/).

TopUp does the same as all the other "box"-scripts, light lightview, thickbox, floatbox, fancybox or lightview. Further, it plays videos in the overlay. It has
the same functionality as the wordpress plugin [lightview plus](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lightview-plus/). Because both have the same code base, the first version of TopUp Plus is 2.5, as the actual version of lightview plus.

This plugin automatically enhance image links to use topup. No need to edit things manual.
